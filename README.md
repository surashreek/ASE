Yoda is a tutoring app for students at Columbia University, specifically for Computer Science courses. We hope that this app services students who need additional help for certain courses they’re taking in a peer-to-peer fashion. It can also be the basis for the formation of study groups when it’s time for midterms/finals.<br \>
